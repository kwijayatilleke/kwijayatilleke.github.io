              <h3>Uno Card Game Simulation Project</h3>
              <p>Play to your Heart's Content!</p>
              <p><strong>Motivation of the Project:</strong> Our group decided to replicate the card game Uno as our project because we all had a childhood experience playing the game Uno countless times. The game is competitive in nature and has several strategic factors to consider in gameplay. Having the game available on your portable laptop means you can play the game anytime, anywhere, even in the dark. You do not need to bring your Uno card game everywhere you go. The game Uno has so many variations in gameplay and rules, so getting to choose what we as a team wanted to include in our own version was definitely a motivation factor. We all have spent numerous hours, weeks, even years playing video games, it just made sense for us to build a project that would be complex in nature, using the four pillars of object-oriented programming, and still be able to produce something enjoyable, an interactive playable Uno computer game with a simple user interface</p>
              <p><strong>What Our Project Does (Functional Requirements):</strong> Our game simulator allows between 2 and 4 players to play the game of Uno through a simple keyboard and screen style user interface. Players will either pass around or spin the computer around like a fidget spinner, depending on how much fun you are having of course. This will allow each player to hide cards from others and choose their fate in the game by making decisions on what action they will take. When a game begins the screen will prompt players to select the number of players (2-4), then each player will enter their name. Once game setup is complete, the screen will inform you who is playing first. Once the player has the computer facing them, they can press the enter key to begin the turn and they will see the 7 cards they've been dealt. You can either choose to play a card (if you have a matching number or color to the card displayed) or draw a new card. Once a turn is completed, the screen prompts you to pass it to the next player. The game follows the standard set of rules from Uno, which include action and wild cards. The actions include skip, reverse, and draw 2. The wilds include wild and wild draw 4. When using a wild card a player selects a color to continue the game with. A player wins only when they have no cards remaining. The winner is displayed on the screen for all to see and then only can the winner get bragging rights.</p>
              <p><strong>Project Design:</strong> Our team spent lots of time developing a robust project design for our Uno simulator. We decided to use Java as our programming language as we felt we had all mastered it and knew it was a reliable option to use centered around the use of objects. Thus, perfect for the four pillars of object-oriented programming. We decided to split the game into manageable components (Cards, Player, Deck, Simulator) following the design review sessions. This made sense to us since these are the main components of the game. This allows us to easily track where a component's attributes and functions are and make desired changes as needed. The Card files (classes) are split into a general Card class (interface) followed by the specific card classes: NumberCard, ActionCard, WildCard. These classes store all the various functionalities and operations specific to the type of card. For our player section we have a class called Player which stores the player name and their hand of cards along with functionalities like play and draw card. Our deck section contains a general file called Deck (abstract class) which is used in DrawingDeck and PlayingDeck classes. DrawingDeck contains functionalities like shuffle, draw, add, deck size. The PlayingDeck contains actions like initialize deck, view the top card, and other comparable operations like DrawingDeck. We have two classes which mitigate gameplay on the computer. The GameManagement class works with gameplay functionalities like starting the game, changing the player, and ending the game. The UnoSimulator is the class that is run when playing the game that runs associated files specific functionalities discussed before. Essentially, it is the backbone of the game. We used the following frameworks in our project: JUnit and Mockito for testing, Gradle and Java Collections Framework for project facilitation, and PlantUML for UML documentation. These were frameworks we had good experience using, and we knew they would be helpful to use in this project. We used Intellij as our project IDE since it has several code writing features that make programming less tedious.</p>
              <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> In this project, my area of focus was writing the unit tests and implementation for the Deck section of classes which consist of an abstract Deck class, DrawingDeck class, and PlayingDeck class which I mention in detail in the previous section. I decided to take on designing the UML diagram once we had a solid understanding of the scope of our project. This facilitated our progress from the design review phase of the project. Additionally, I provided my insight and ideas into to the implementation of the UnoSimulator which handles the GameManagement for the Uno game. I worked in a timely manner and provided my insight into team members code. In completing this project, I am well experienced in the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. This has enabled me to be more planning focused in project development and thus will be encountering less problems in terms of bugs and complex issues. I am well capable of creating my own project of complex nature in the future. Working in this team was great, we had great communication and this enabled us to be successful. I know that communication is key to success when it comes to collaborative work. I am well versed in unit testing and class design-development.</p>
